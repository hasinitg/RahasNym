# RahasNym

RahasNym is a pseudonymous identity management system supporting unlinkable and accountable online transactions, which thereby preserves usersâ€™ privacy while providing a strong assurance on the authenticity of the transactions to the service providers. 

RahasNym provides a light weight policy language which enables users and service providers to express their requirements pertaining to pseudonymous identity verification and a suite of protocols based on zero-knowledge-proofs which enables the fulfillment of these requirements.

Here, we provide a prototype implementation which simulates an ecommerce usecase on top of RahasNym. The system architecture is shown in the following figure.
