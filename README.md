# README #

My scratch area contains the code which I keep private until they come to a reasonable level to be published in my public git repo.

### What is this repository for? ###

This contains:
1. CryptoLib
2. RahasNym
3. My algorithm practicing code.
4. My personal web site.

### How do I get set up? ###

Here I document how to setup RahasNym samples:

1. Checkout CryptoLib and RahasNym Code
2. Build CryptoLib first and then RahasNym
3. Install apache tomcat
4. Fix the paths appropriately in the deoployLocally.sh file and run it.
5. Start tomcat.
6. Run the UserDevice.java in RahasNymLib/tests to see how different protocols execute.
7. If you want to see the demo of a real world scenario, run the service provider webapp which illustrates on-line shopping scenario.
