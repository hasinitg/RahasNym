    				<p>I am Hasini Gunasinghe from Sri Lanka. I believe happiness and peacefulness in mind as one of the most important things in life, therefore I try to stay happy and peaceful myself while trying to make my loved ones and others happy too. :)</p>
				
				<p> I am currently in the second year of PhD program in Department of Computer Science at Purdue University.
My subject areas of interest are information security, cryptography and machine learning. I work as graduate research assistant and my research supervisor is Professor Elisa Bertino. I carry out research on biometrics-based authentication and digital identity management techniques.</p> 
				<p>My passion is to contribute to human advancement with the use of technology. When combined it with my areas of interests, my goal is to develop techniques to make digital identity a secure, privacy preserving and usable thing for all. Sharing what I learn new with others is another passion which keeps me motivated. I currently do it though my blogs, during my free time.</p>

				<p>Before joining grad school, I worked as a Software Engineer in WSO2 Inc where I was a member of its Security and Identity Server team. I obtained my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.</p>
			
				<p>I belonged to a wonderful family and I am in lovee with a wonderful person, all of whose love is what I cherish the most. I love reading, music, watching movies and also travelling to different parts of the world.</p>
